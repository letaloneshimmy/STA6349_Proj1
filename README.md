Beta BINOM Project Unmask Scooby Villain Motive 
Consider the emotions from [Inside Out](https://disney.fandom.com/wiki/Inside_Out_2#Cast). [Joy](https://disney.fandom.com/wiki/Joy), [Fear](https://disney.fandom.com/wiki/Fear), and [Ennui](https://disney.fandom.com/wiki/Ennui) are binge watching Scooby Doo for the first time. After a few episodes, they discuss the probability of unmasking the villain. [Anxiety](https://disney.fandom.com/wiki/Anxiety) has recently taken an interest in Bayesian analysis and decides to exploit this opportunity and play around with the beta-binomial conjugate family. She asks each of her fellow emotions two questions:

-   Based on the last 10 episodes you watched, what do you think the probability of unmasking is?

-   How certain are you of that probability?

Perpetually bored, [Ennui](https://disney.fandom.com/wiki/Ennui) shrugs when asked each question. Perpetually afraid, [Fear](https://disney.fandom.com/wiki/Fear) implies that he is not very confident that the gang will unmask the villain... and he's not very confident about that, either. Perpetually positive, [Joy](https://disney.fandom.com/wiki/Joy) excitedly says that she's very sure that the probability of unmasking is high - of course the gang will get them!

Group members will divide and conquer the data categories in their respective areas. The outcome of interest is if the villain was unmasked or not (*unmasked*, created earlier).

In this project, you will:

1.  Use the data from 1969 (first season) to update each character's prior. What are their posterior distributions?

2.  Perform sequential analysis and update the posterior distribution for each decade that data was collected.

3.  Evaluate and describe the progression of beliefs of each emotion.

    -   Are the beliefs *different* based on the characteristics explored by your group?

        -   Note: We have not formally learned Bayesian inference -- I am asking you to use the occular method of analysis for now.

Then, your group will create a 10 minute presentation (yes, with Quarto slides) to discuss the progression of beliefs.

-   Because the audience of your presentation is at the same level of understanding, no introductory explanations of Bayesian analysis are necessary.

-   Please organize your presentation as you see fit. What is the story that your group wants to tell? Do you want to tell the story character-by-character? Decade-by-decade?

-   **Professional development:** Create a gif using [`gganimate`](https://gganimate.com/) that demonstrates the characters' understanding over time.



## Group 4: Villian Motive

**Research Question:** Does the villain's motive impact the likelihood of successful capture in Scooby Doo episodes?
